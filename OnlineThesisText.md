<summary> Quantz et al. 2022: LIFE Paper 1: Improved exoplanet detection yield estimates </summary>

Description of LIFE space mission with 4 formation flying infrared telescopes. Paper presents an intstrument simulator with all sources of astrophysical noise (but not yet including instrumental noise) which was coupled with the P-Pop Monte Carlo tool of a synthetic exoplanet population. The gain (yield per unit time) was averaged over 500 MC realisations.

Based on 4 2m apertures, it was estimated that within 20 p of the sun, 25-45 rocky exoplanets within the habitable zones could be detected, and doubling these numbers with 3,5m apertures. In a first observation, estimates of radii and effective temperatures of exoplanets could be made, followed by estimates of thermal emission spectra in a second visit.

It is known from Kepler, Tess and Radial Velocity surveys that planets similar to Earth should be very abundant. In the future, James Webb Space Telescope may reveal if planets around red dwarfs can retain their atmospheres despite high levels of activity of their host stars. 

ESA's Ariel will provide transmission and emission spectra of exoplanets with warm hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The ~30m ground based Extremely Large Telescopes will be able to detect thermal spectra of small planets around nearby stars using the mid-infrared METIS spectrograph. In addition, the PCS and HIRES will detect via reflected light.

[Add some words about PLATO]

The US-led Habitable Exoplanet Observatory HabEx and the Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor LUVOIR  is intended to study the atmospheres of several dozen small exoplanets in Habitable Zones via reflected light.

Several high-precision RV instruments are planned: CARMENES, NIRPS, ESPRESSO, MAROON-X, HARPS3, EXPRES, so it is expected that a significant fraction of exoplanets within 20 pc will be uncovered. In that case, more LIFE observation time can go to characterisation.

LIFE explores the development of a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer within ESA's Voyage 2050 program, building upon studies of the Darwin mission and Terrestrial Planet Finder - Interferometer. The study would exist of a direct detection phase, followed by a characterisation phase. This paper focusses on the detection phase. 

Advantages of working in the mid-infrared: More direct constraints on temperature and size of the objects, and spectrum includes molecular absorption lines including biosignatures.

The yield simulation includes single main sequence stars and wide separation binaries <span style="color:green">(what happens to close binaries?)</span> and NASA's ExoPaG SAG13 underlying exoplanet occurrence rates. The signal as measured from a planetary system in a 6:1 X-array configuration of nulling-interferometry is simulated using LIFEsim. The short baselines are 'nulling baselines' responsible for dark fringes, the long baselines are 'imaging baselines' responsible for high frequency modulation of the transmission map perpendicular to the modulation map. The 6:1 baseline seems more robust against instability noise than the 2:1 ratio <span style="color:green"> (!) </span>

The simulations assumed separations between the spacecrafts of 10 to 600m, 2m aperture size and 5% optical throughput. All major astrophysical noise terms were included: Planetary photon noise assuming black-body emission, photon noise due to stellar leakage into the dark fringe, noise from exozodi disks, assumed to be optically thin, smooth and face-on, and photon noise from local zodiacal light aka dust in our Solar System, which is overcome by pointing in anti-sunward direction. 

Instrumental effects were neglected. What is unknown for now is 1) the impact of phase and/or amplitude variations as systematic noise sources, and 2) thermal background from the aperture mirrors. The S/N calculations assume the use of single-mode fibers (?). 

The detection criterion was S/N>7 where the S/N was taken as the square root of the sum of the instrumental and astrophysical noise. Here the instrumental noise was assumed lower than the astrophysical noise. (Why astrophysical signal of S/N>5?). It seems that if the S/N is sufficiently high, the radius, effective temperature and a very rough SED can be estimated by first observation to first order. 

There are two ways in which the scenario can be optimised: maximising the *total* number of detected exoplanets, or maximising the number of **rocky exoplanets within the eHZ Habitable Zone*, which leads to a decrease in the total number of detectable planets. Temperate rocky exoplanets in the eHZ are fainter than objects closer to the star and therefore require >3x more integration time. In absolute numbers, rocky eHZ exoplanets occur more around M dwarfs because M dwarfs are more numerous in the solar neighbourhood. 

Comparing the theoretical number of planets in the simulation to those that are detected, the required sensitivity is the main factor rather than the spatial resolution. The detections approximately double/half with the aperture size from 1/2/3.5m. The yield is comparable to LUVOIR. 

It has been argued by previous studies that 30 to 50 exoplanets need to be studied to get statistically robust results on the fraction of habitable rocky HZ exoplanets. It is unknown if exoplanets around M-dwarfs can sustain atmospheres, but hopefully JWST will give insights on this. Depending on this result, LIFE will be an excellent next step with a detection bias around M dwarfs, and otherwise M stars should be deprioritised. HabEx and LUVOIR have detection bias for solar-type stars.
