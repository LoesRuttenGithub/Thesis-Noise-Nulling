# Online thesis text


Here I will update my work on my thesis as we go. It is intended to be structured but not as formal as the final text. To be discussed: Which content can be in a public folder.

## Meetings 
- Romain & Loes 3 May
	- Topic 1
	- Topic 2
		1. Subtopic 1
		2. Subtopic 2
- Romain & Loes 29 May
- Leuven/Delft/Liege consortium meeting 10 July
- WG 3.2 meeting 11 July
- Romain & Loes 11 July
	- Added to LIFE Slack. Most relevant groups are 3.2, 3.3, 4.1
- Romain & Ida & Lian 11 July
	- MC simulations take long. Python functionality to dump outcomes
 of MC into file once and load it in from there.
	- Python code gives error on Windows because it doesn't have a /tmp folder as in Unix based systems.
	- Idea to have joint meeting with Delft & Leuven every other week? To be figured out what is feasible for everyone. 
	- 3rd week of August, internal office moving in Delft should be done


## Planning

Just a first rough outline as conversation starter! Anything can be adapted.

| Month | Activity | Hours|
| --- | --- | --- |
| July & August | Exploration: Literature and research plan | 150h|
| September | Deep thinking: Extend theoretical concept | 150h|
| October-December | Implementation: Create new tool or integrate existing tools | 150h|
| January- mid-February| TU Delft-based applications | 150h|
| mid-February - mid-March| Writing and knowledge transfer | 150h|
| mid-March - end-March| Buffer | 150h|



Explore [150h] July & August

- Explore key questions in instrumental noise for nulling interferometry
- Explore which theoretical concepts are exciting and realistic to further work out in the scope of the thesis
- Explore synergies between Leuven/Romain's work and Delft/JerÃ´me/Ida's work
- Write down literature and research plan in coherent document

Deep thinking [150h] September

- Work out theory further for analytical or somewhat analytical+numerical component (tbd)
- How to know the covariance matrix, given our knowledge on the instrument architecture and a small bit of observations. 

Implement something [150h] October-December

- Try out some new innovative approach, and/or
- Integrate existing elements in SCIFYsim, LIFEsim?

Apply / test [150h] January - mid-February

- Bridge to work in Delft and partners

Bring together [150h] mid-Feb - mid-March

- Wrap-up
- Write down
- Present / defend thesis
- Sustainable handover

Buffer [150h] rest of March

Next thesis deadline: mid-June
